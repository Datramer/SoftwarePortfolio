# Overview


This program is designed to accept a string as an input and will return feedback and a rating about the strength of the string as a password

This software was written to familarize myself with c# and get some practice with the basics.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
