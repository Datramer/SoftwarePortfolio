# Overview


This game is based on asteroids, a classic game. But with twist. Instead of trying to destroy astreroids you can only dodge them! to aid you in this you have a dodge button that triggers when you press space. This was based heavily on the code found in the link below.

I wrote this software to refresh my python knowledge and get more accustomed to the pygames library.
